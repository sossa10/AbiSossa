The amazon river is located between Colombia, Brazil and Perú. In this river it can be spotted animals such as the Piranhas, the Amazonian Manatee and the Pink Amazon Dolphin. It is curious to know that there are no bridges on the river, considering that in some particular spots of the river is it possible to cross it by foot.
The number of tributaries of the river is superior to 1.000 and at the moment there is a conflict between the Nile River and the Amazon River, as the scientific community haven’t decided yet which of the two is the longest river in the world. An amazing data from this river, in order to understands its dimensions, is that approximately 20 per cent of the sweet water from the oceans come from this river.
Sadly, the river is contaminated as there is agricultural and mining activities in the region. That is why is important for the young generations to understand the importance of this river and work to change the situation in the short term.
